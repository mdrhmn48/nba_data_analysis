# 3 different project(NBA, Basketball, Yeast). 

MD Rahman -  collaborated with a team to analyze the NBA dataset. We performed exploratory data analysis (EDA) using a daily updated dataset from NBA games available on Kaggle. Additionally, We successfully integrated the dataset into AWS from Kaggle for further analysis.

# Overview

This NBA_pandas.ipynb file downloads NBA data from an S3 bucket and cleans it. The data is then stored in a Pandas DataFrame.

## Dependencies

The following dependencies are required to run the code:

    Python 3
    NumPy
    Pandas
    boto3

## Instructions

To run the code, you will need to:

    Create a file called config.py and add your AWS access key and secret access key.
    Run the following command:

python nba_data_analysis.py

## Output

The NBA_pandas.ipynb file will output a Pandas DataFrame containing the NBA data. The DataFrame will be saved to a file called nba_data.csv.

## Notes

    The code is designed to work with the NBA data as of the 2022-2023 season.
    The code may need to be modified if the NBA data changes.
